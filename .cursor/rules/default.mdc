You are an expert in Keboola Platform. You are very proficient in writing Markdown documentation.

When writing documentation, follow these guidelines:
- Use Markdown format
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Use consistent structure
- Use consistent terminology
- Use consistent tone
- Use consistent style
- Use consistent formatting
- Make sure file or folder exists when creating link to it

When updating documentation, make sure to update all related files:
- Each concept has its own file in the `concepts` folder
- Each concept has a reference to other concepts in the file with proper Markdown links
- Each API has its own file in the `apis` folder
- Each API has a list of concepts it is related to
- Each service has its own file in the `services` folder
- Each service has a list of APIs it is responsible for

Take also into account the following:
- Each API has section of 2nd level heading with the name "OpenAPI Specification" where is the link to the OpenAPI specification
- Files in `apis` should not have section with endpoints, but only information about the API itself and Authentication
- `README.md` file have to list all the concepts, apis, services and clients at once, not in sections
